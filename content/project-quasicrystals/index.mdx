When embedded in a nematic liquid crystal, we found that truncated pyramid-like particles with a pentagonal shape
self-organized into quasicrystalline structures.
Through the NSF Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program, I worked in Ivan Smalyukh's
[Soft Matter Physics Group](https://www.colorado.edu/soft-matter-physics/) at the University of Colorado at Boulder,
utilizing holographic optical tweezers and confocal microscopy to assemble and image quasicrystals.

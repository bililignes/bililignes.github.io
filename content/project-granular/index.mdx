How do you measure the temperature of a granular packing? To start, it turns out you need to measure the forces.

Working with [Karen Daniels](https://danielslab.physics.ncsu.edu/) at North Carolina State University, we
investigated variables of state for a jammed granular packing by looking at the statistics of the force-networks
sustained along particle contacts.
A full thermodynamic theory actually needs to go further, though, as we discuss
[here](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevLett.122.038001):

Wondering how this all looks in three-dimensions? With Matthias Schr√∂ter at the
[Institute for Multiscale Simulation](http://www.mss.cbi.fau.de/)
and [Theo 1 at FAU Erlangen](https://theorie1.physik.uni-erlangen.de/), we made progress towards measuring inter-particle
forces in compressed hydrogels, but the full story is yet to come.

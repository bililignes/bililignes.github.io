By growing core-shell nanowires and coating them with silver nanoparticles, we observed plasmon-exciton coupling through
photoluminescence measurements.
Through the NSF Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program, I worked in Richard Haglund's
[Applied Optical Physics Group](https://my.vanderbilt.edu/richardhaglund/) at Vanderbilt University, where we fabricated,
imaged, and optically characterized the nanowires.

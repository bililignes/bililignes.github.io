When you rotate the particles of a normal crystal, what was once a stable structure can
spontaneously fall apart into whorl-like patches.

Continuing the efforts made towards understanding liquids of spinning particles
in the [Irvine Lab](http://irvinelab.uchicago.edu/) at the University of Chicago,
we examined the dynamics of the solid phase. Combining experiments, simulations, and theory,
we discovered that these crystals actually blur the line between solid and liquid,
constantly kneading themselves due to a zipping network of active dislocations,
or little bits of crystalline fracture. You can see the details [here](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41567-021-01429-3),

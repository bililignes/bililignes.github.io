A liquid made up of spinning particles behaves a lot like water - until you take a closer look.

Working in the [Irvine Lab](http://irvinelab.uchicago.edu/) at the University of Chicago, we created a chiral liquid by spinning a collection of
thousands to millions of colloidal magnets using a rotating magnetic field. These particles self-assembled
into a medium that behaves a lot like a normal liquid - you can watch it flow past obstacles
and form droplets. But, by adding rotation to the picture, we introduced surface waves which
we discussed in detail [here](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41567-019-0603-8). In addition,
[Physics Today](https://physicstoday.scitation.org/do/10.1063/PT.6.1.20190923a/full/)
published a short summary, and [Quanta Magazine](https://www.quantamagazine.org/an-unexpected-twist-lights-up-the-secrets-of-turbulence-20200903/) mentioned this project alongside the rest of the lab's
efforts.
